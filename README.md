# Cuis-Smalltalk-DWM
Tiling window management in Cuis, very much in the spirit of http://dwm.suckless.org

Still very experimental, will change in the future as I go along using it. For now these are some keyboard shortcuts:

alt-esc to toggle full screen on the focused window

alt-t to toggle the focused window between tiling or floating modes

alt-1 to alt-9 to switch to another page

alt-shift-1 to alt-shift-9 to move the focused window to another page

alt-shift-B to open a browser, W open a workspace, C a changesorter, etc.

Here are some screenshots:

Two browsers and a workspace in tiling:

A floating browser with halos on it (windows dont have decorations or controls, but we have halos!):

The pre-debugger is kind of incomplete without the title with the exception description, maybe I should show window titles on some windows?:

A browser on fullscreen:
